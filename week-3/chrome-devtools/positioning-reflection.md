  #• How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
    ○ Inspecting the elements and changing the values on the inspector.
  #• How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
    ○ On CSS you do that by using width and height. Also you have to check that the elements are set to display block, divs display block by default but it the element normally displays inline it won't accept a width.
  
    ○ Making sure they display block  or inline-block first and changing their width and height
  #• What are the differences between Absolute,   ○Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
    ○ Position static in my case is the most difficult to understand when you'd use this, it is the default setting and when it is used the top, bottom, left and right loose any effect.
    ○ Relative: this means it shifts from it's normal position in the specified value. It goes top x amount of pixels of where it would normally be.
    ○ Fixed: This is relative to the viewport and it's a sticky position because it just stays there.
    ○ Absolute: It´s also relative to the view port but it's not fixed!


  #• What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
    ○ Margin is the space between the element and the objects around it
    ○ Border is the limits of the object
    ○ Padding is the space between the content and border.
 # • What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
    ○ Liked it but I would put some spans inside the divs to make the difference between the positioning more evident.
