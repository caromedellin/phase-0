#  Reflection
=begin
  I refactored a bit, I missed my GSP but I like the refactoring now
  I wan not completely enthusiastic about it next week because I did not want to use methods with out fully understanding them
  So it helped me to keep them long but as the program grows it becomes easier to debug and build when everything has been refactored
