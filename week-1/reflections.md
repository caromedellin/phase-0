## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
Time boxing
Adding Habits to existing ones
Celebrating small accomplishments
The power of changing your mindset
Meditation changes your whole day (I was surprised when I implemented it one morning and saw it physically: I dead lifted more weight at the gym than ever before right after the first time I ever attempted to meditate. I thought that even though I didn't have any special mind awakening that was a very quantifiable way to see improvement, and I was really surprised.)
Focus on the process and what you can like about it
Start small, really small.
What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
It's like a pomodoro session but for a team and after the time limit is reached then the team stops to evaluate the progress. The rule is to stop.
It can be used during pairing sessions, and throughout team work projects. I think it helps to see if the effort put in to working is being used efficiently so you can change your approach if it's not being efficient.
How do you manage your time currently?
I'm focusing on nailing my morning and then taking it from there. But I have been way too relaxed about my goals.
Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
My strategy has not been super ambitious lately. I just settle for 3 sessions of 25 min study. This week I will add a lot more structure but I am actually pleased at my small changes, I'm really enjoying my study time, although the organization of that time could be better. I have been reading more than doing exercises and now I need to start practicing. I suppose it was a lack of confidence and I used to get upset when I couldn't solve an exercise so I would drop it and just read, but you learn a lot more by doing. Meditation has been helping a lot to control the urge of dropping the exercise.
Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
Start a Calendar chunking the week in day sessions:
Day to day schedule:
Wake up and drag my body to the couch to meditate for 20 min.
Get ready to go to school (I'm not going to school… I struggle with mornings so I do a pretend routine that consists of getting ready as if I was going to school)
Run to the door, touch it and run back to the couch to do my first pomodoro session.
SO FAR I HAVE BEEN NAILING THAT!.... Then it gets tricky
Get outside with all of my things and get settle at a coffee shop for the second pomodoro session.
Study for a while and add 2 more sessions around the day.
6pm go to dancing classes or gym
Go home, have dinner, relax
Pack my things for the next day, review my calendar and draw some happy faces
##1.2 The Command Line Reflection

    1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"
      1. Shell is what you see from a program.  In the case of terminal it would be the program that is used to type the command line or the bash, that is the language. The unix shell has utilities and simple components that make it's use way more efficient that changing things manually. 
    2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
    I could not understand at the beginning the difference between shell and bash
    3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
    Yes but I have my terminal configured with hearts and I don't want to change it :(
    4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
    In my personal opinion the arguments that get used the most are pwd and ls, then cd. Actually the order in which they are taught is very accurate, first you want to learn how to navigate your files.
     
    5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
    -pwd
    Print working directory, prints your location, the full pathname
    -ls
    Lists all the files and folders in the folder your parent directory
    -mv
    Moves a file, and you can rename it too
    -cd
    Change directory if you add . You just go up
    -../
    Takes you up one directory
    -touch
    Created a file, as if touched by the hand of god.
    -mkdir
    Creates a folder.  Touch is not for folders, which was confusing the first time around, because touch sounds a lot more important.
    -less
    Allows you see the beginning of the content of a file so you don't have to open the whole file, which is more efficient.
    -rmdir
    Gets rid of a folder, but it only works on empty files, probably because when you remove something from terminal, your computer expects you to know what you are doing.
    -rm
    Deletes a file, some files and some folders are stubborn and you have to delete them using -r when they have content and -f when you are gangster and don't care, you don't need confirmation.
    -help
Offers help, my computer only does it when she feels like it.
##1.4 Forking and Cloning • If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
  ○ Suppose you want to get an open source code, such as one to hack someone's computer using only a USB, but you have no clue of how to code, so you are thankful it's open source and wonder why anyone would let you have it...
  You could clone it, because you won't start a new repo and just magically get there (you don't even know how to make a webpage anyway and a black sublime text page will not turn in to). But, you won't clone it because that would mess up the original repo if you make a mistake!  And they have already have been super nice and thoughtful enough to put it there so you can sabotage someone's computer! So you won't do that! You will FORK IT, so you can work on it without damaging the original copy.
  ○ You click where it says fork
  ○ You select your own profile
  ○ You wait for octocat to deliver, it might take a little bit but you will have a cool animated copy machine with a fork.
  ○ Then there's that repo that looks magical!
  ○ Now you need to clone it so it will be on your very own computer!
    ○ So you go to the left side of your screen and you copy the weird little webpage type of adress that appears there!
    ○ Then you open up your terminal and go to a safe location where you will hide the files you are cloning, once you are there you type the following
      § Git clone (and you press [cmd +v])
      § And there should be some bang! Or boom! To alert you about what you just did but there's not. In any case you succesfully forked a repo

• What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
  The first time I used it I had problems with the password so I learned that you have to google a lot during phase 0.
