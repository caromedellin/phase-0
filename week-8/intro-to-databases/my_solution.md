#Release 7: Reflect
In the reflection section in your my_solution.md file, answer the following questions:
It's a collection of data, except NoSQL that and object oriented data bases, they also narrow down the data.
What are databases for?
To keep track of things, draw conclusions and find patterns.
It also makes information easy to be accessed modified, organized and classified.
What is a one-to-many relationship?
This is when a parent record in one table can potentially reference several child elements in another table.

What is a primary key? What is a foreign key? How can you determine which is which?
A primary key is the one that belongs to a data base and it needs to be unique a foreign key belong to another data base but it's used to connect them, they don't necessarily have to be unique.

How can you select information out of a SQL database? What are some general guidelines for that?

Using SELECT element FROM data_base;
and also using the *
in SELECT * FROM data_base;
some general rules are to always finish your statements with ; like in JS
you can also combine it with other options such as 
  SELECT * FROM element WHERE data_base > 8;
And in this case the elements that will be selected will only be the ones with the value of element greater than 8.
WHERE is a conditional and it can be followed by <,> = != or by BETWEEN AND or by LIKE. those act like selectors that filter your database.
