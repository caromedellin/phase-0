# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# This challenge took me [#] hours.

# Pseudocode

# fibonacci formula 
# num = (16/10)^num/âˆš5

# Initial Solution

def is_fibonacci?(num)
  x = 5 * num * num
  if (Math.sqrt(x + 4)-Math.sqrt(x + 4).floor).zero? || (Math.sqrt(x - 4)-Math.sqrt(x - 4).floor).zero?
    return true
  else
    return false
  end
end



# Refactored Solution
# I wanted to used the formula I still haven't fully solved it. I know you can create a series with inject and then check if the number is there.
# I'm behind a bit this week! I'll come back to this.
