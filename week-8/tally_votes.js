// Pseudocode
// for(voter in votes)
//   for (office in voter)
//     if voter count has an object of everything that is nested under office
//       (name under office) inside VoteCount +=1
//     else
//       name(under office) inside VoteCount =1
// next error is to identify winner
// since voteCount has new objects assigned Iâ€™ll iterate over them
// for every office in voteCount
// create a place holder with the maximum of votes (so there will be 4 max votes equal to 0)
// for every candidate for each office
//   if the value inside the candidate is greater than the place holder 
//     place holder = value inside candidate
//     office inside officer is reassigned to candidate every loop (only when condition is met)

//       voteCount[office][(votes[voter][office])] += 1;
//     }
//     else {
//       voteCount[office][(votes[voter][office])] = 1;
//     }
//     console.log(votes[voter][office])
//   }
// }

// console.log(voteCount.president);
// for (var office in voteCount) {
//   var winnerVote = 0;
//   for (var candidate in voteCount[office]) {
//      console.log(candidate)
//      if(voteCount[office][candidate] >= winnerVote) {
//       winnerVote = voteCount[office][candidate]; 
//        officers[office] = candidate;

// __________________________________________
// Reflection
// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// I like loops in JS mainly because I read that even though they are not the most elegant they are the fastest
// Or so I read, I guess in a function this small it doesn't particularly matter but if this were a national vote I'd go for a for loop
// I learned that it's complicated to always grasp the proper object and for that reason I like to use the console.log and check first if I'm grabbing the proper object.
// I find it ends up saving me time..
// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// Yes the hasOwnProperty was very useful, Every object descended from Object inherits the hasOwnProperty method.
//  This method can be used to determine whether an object has the specified property as a direct property of that object; unlike the in operator,
//  this method does not check down the object's prototype chain. 

// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
// It solidify the accessing of values for me and also the pushing objects and values in to an existing object.
