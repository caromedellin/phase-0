##1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
1. Information Gathering

2. Planning

3. Design

4. Development

5. Testing and Delivery

6. Maintenance

2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The goal of my website is to show a portfolio and some of my interest to employers. There will be some other webpages I will eventually create as examples. My target audience would be people that are looking for junior developers so I would address them with a pretty portfolio that contained lot's of features to display the things I can do. And that possibly told a story so I'd appear at least UX design conscious.

##3. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I decided they should first look at the projects I'm working on because I don't have a portfolio yet and my contact info. I want to focus on mobile first webpages so first it would be info, like a business card and then a project I'm working on.


##4. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  That if your site is not UX design focused of at least conscious no one will want to be in it unless they have to. 

##5. What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

Because webpages have changed from information exchange between scientist to being a product. The more time a person spends on your website the more likely you are to make a statement or a profit. It's a more competitive market than it used to be, and webpages are have an elastic demand since there are so many and they can sometimes be almost the same. So user design is what is making a difference in keeping relevant. If you manage to make an interaction and tell a story to your audience you make a solid enough connection to become a preferred alternative.

  • A/B testing
Making 2 versions of something and comparing them
  • User surveys
Asking your users
  • Wire frames and prototypes
Design on wireframe before you start typing a mess
  • User flows
What problems or experiences users will encounter while surfing, so you avoid sending 3 alerts for one problem, so a lot of use. Seams like people code a lot for the marginal cases.
  • Story telling
To engage the user, some webpages are super boring, this is my favorite for story telling: kano.me
  • Design patterns
What's the best way to deliver a content? A video? A chart? Slides? Kind of like who wore it best but everyone looks pretty square.
  • User profiles and personas
You get them out of your user's data
  • Content inventory
Proposes changes in info architecture, so a person doesn't have to take the specific main tour of the website you want to give them. (or at least that's how I understood it)
  • Content style guides
There's a list of don't in styles, I think it's like the fashion police

This all sounds very subjective, but there are tools to measure this such as 
  • A/B testing software
    ○ Compares the traffic  in equal segments with different versions
  • Content inventory software
    ○ An account of your inventory WordPress already has it built in
  • User testing and feedback software
    ○ Survey apps
  • Analytics software
    ○ Analysis the traffic in websites so you can make hypothesis on why there's a change in it

##6. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

It seams a bit too muchg to learn this with out having all the tools to actually make comparisons but I think it's good to have in mind that some heads are better than others in readability
