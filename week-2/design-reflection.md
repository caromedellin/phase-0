2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

3. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

4. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

5. What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

Because webpages have changed from information exchange between scientist to being a product. The more time a person spends on your website the more likely you are to make a statement or a profit. It's a more competitive market than it used to be, and webpages are have an elastic demand since there are so many and they can sometimes be almost the same. So user design is what is making a difference in keeping relevant. If you manage to make an interaction and tell a story to your audience you make a solid enough conection to become a prefered alternative.
