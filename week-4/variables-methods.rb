=begin 
How do you define a local variable?
  var = somethind
How do you define a method?
  def method
    does something
  end
What is the difference between a local variable and a method?
  a variable points to a piece of data and a method takes variables and uses them

How do you run a ruby program from the command line?
  ruby name_of_program.rb
How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?
  rspec rspec_file.rb (or name_of_program.rb if you did not have good practice class and stored it on the same file for convinience)
What was confusing about this material? What made sense?
  I had no clue of what to do with rspec files or tests and I still don't know how to write them, the video was a lecture and got me lost on what to do with them
    During the week I understood what they were but they are still very confusing
    it's also mindblowing the built in methods in ruby!
